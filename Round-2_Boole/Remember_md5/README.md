# Remember md5?

### Challenge
> Oh. Those good old days of md5 and huge rainbow tables. I get nostalgic just thinking about it. Well, you can’t use one of those to break my password. It still isn’t very secure though. I only used my favorite characters ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’. I remember it being about 14 characters long. The hash is 1b657b7fe26eda5b3c1309d340f1674d.

### Hint
> When all else fails, try brute force.

### Solution
I attempted to bruteforce, which took about 30 seconds on my PC. 
*(See the [Python script](bruteforce.py))*
Hence, the flag is `abbabcbabcbabcb`.

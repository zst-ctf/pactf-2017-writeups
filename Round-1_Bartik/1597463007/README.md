### Challenge
> The number 0x5f3759df is very special, it is the magic behind an otherwise rather-annoying mathematical operation. What is the result of that operation applied to 0.25?

### Hint

### Solution
After googling `0x5f3759df`, we find the [first result from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root) which tells us this number is used in an algorithm for calculating inverse square roots.

The inverse square root of 0.25 = 2. Hence, the flag is `2`

# Whence I Came

### Challenge
> Open Sourcery
> Look from where I came! The key is somewhere in there… or at least it’d like to be!

### Hint
> I am the creation of open sourcery!

### Solution
Looking at their source code on GitHub, I found this [commit](https://github.com/PACTF/pactf/commit/9345ac104a8453914ee4d1fcb72546ab7162d50a)
Hence, the flag is `WELCOME_TO_PACTF_2017`

# Think of the Cube 

### Challenge
> I found this floating around on a piece of paper while geocaching. What could `dqow_UrrEcxbaDdfgwwIhww` possibly mean?

### Hint
> What are some weird ciphers? Maybe originally involving a cube?

### Solution

Doing a quick search for `cube cipher` leads us to `Trifid Cipher`.

Using a [Trifid Cipher decoder](http://www.geocachingtoolbox.com/index.php?page=trifidCipher), we get the result: `flag_WowWierdCipherHere`
